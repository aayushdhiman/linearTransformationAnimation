# Animation of a Linear Transformation
___
A Python animation that shows a linear transformation based on input matrices. Final project for Northeastern's CS 2810 class. 

## Usage
___
Run this file using the following:
    python linear_transformation_ver_2 -c1 0 0 -c2 0 0 -v 1 1
This will animate a linear transformation using the vector [[1] [1]] and the transformation matrix [[0 0] [0 0]].
You can change the values following -c1, -c2, and -v to change the columns of the transformation matrix and the vector.
